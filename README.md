# SVMagicTrainer
This project demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine(SVM), to train and subsequently test a dataset containing age and salary of 400 people and to estimate who will purchase a car. A confusion matrix and accuracy score is also created.
